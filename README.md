# README

Simple template repository for quickly starting a new Python project that uses
[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). It includes a
Github action that runs on pushes and pull requests as well as a
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) configuration that runs Black on every
commit locally.

NOTE: you may want to edit the Python version in the pre-commit configuration.
